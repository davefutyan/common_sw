/**
 *  @class TriggerFile
 *
 *  <b>General information</b>
 *
 *  In general, all programs running inside the processing pipelines will
 *  produce an output trigger file. This file is created automatically by the
 *  CheopsExit() function. The trigger file contains the
 *
 *  - pass id (if applicable),
 *  - program type,
 *  - program id,
 *  - request id,
 *  - visit counter,
 *  - validity period
 *  - OBSID
 *
 *  The purpose of the trigger file is to notify the pipeline framework that the
 *  program has terminated, and the framework uses this information do decide on
 *  which program to execute next. The next program will receive the trigger
 *  file created by the previous program as input. The framework uses the
 *  information in the output trigger file when it queries the Archive for the
 *  input files of the next program.

 *  The output trigger file will contain the same values that were present in
 *  the program's input trigger file.

 *  If there is a trigger file in a program's input, the file will appear in the
 *  job order under the data product type "TRIGGER". The ProgramParams will
 *  automatically read this file and make the contents available through static
 *  getter methods on the TriggerFile class.
 *
 *  Trigger files must adhere to the schema defined in
 *  $CHEOPS_SW/resources/trigger_file_schema.xsd. This schema follows the
 *  Earth Explorer format.
 *  Example:
 *
 *  @verbinclude trigger_file_example.xml
