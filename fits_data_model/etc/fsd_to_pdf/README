This directory contains the script fsdtopdf.sh which generates a human-readable
description of .fsd files in the form of PDF files. As an intermediate step in
the process of creating the PDF, HTML files are also generated. 

To generate the PDF and HTML files, simply run

sh ./fsdtopdf.sh

The script must be run from this directory in order to correctly locate the .fsd
files.

The output files are placed in the directory doc/fits_data_model.


Dependencies:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - xsltproc, which is available on standard Apple OS/X installations
  - wkhtmltopdf v0.12 or higher. 
    Note:
      - Versions earlier than 0.12 do not support repeating table headers when
        tables span over a page break.
      - The 64-bit release of v0-12 for OSX has a bug that causes the text in 
        pdf documents to be non-selectable. To avoid this, install the 32-bit 
        release of v0.12. 
      - Version 0.12.5 has a bug that causes it to not output table of contents.
    Available from http://wkhtmltopdf.org. 


Trouble shooting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* wkhtmltopdf segfaults when loading header and footers.

This is a known bug, see https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/issues/1681
It is caused by wkhtmltopdf opening more files at once than what is allowed by 
the system. The work-around is to increase the maximum number of files that a 
program is allowd to open, and re-run the script.

On OSX Yosemite this is done using the ulimit program. Run ulimit -a to see the
current maximum number of allowed open files. Run ulimit -n X, where X is the
new maximum limit. This changes the limit for the current shell only.
